## Question 5: 📄 There Are 10 Pages But Only Showing 4?

**Answer:** This is a pagination/display issue.

**Current Status:**
- The Pages admin shows pagination at bottom
- Set to display 10 pages per page
- If you're only seeing 4, that means you have 4 pages total currently

**How to Check:**
1. Go to Admin → Pages
2. Look at bottom: "Showing 1 to 4 of 4 pages"
3. Stats cards at top show actual count

**Possible Reasons:**
- You actually have 4 pages (not 10)
- Some pages might be in database but not showing
- Search filter might be active

**To See All Pages:**
1. Clear any search filters
2. Check "Total Pages" stat card
3. If database says 10 but showing 4, there's a sync issue

**Fix:** Check database directly or let me know and I can investigate.
